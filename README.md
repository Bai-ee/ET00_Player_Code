### NO CODE customization

2) Replace the existing .wav file "track.wav" with your own file labeled "track.wav"
3) Compress folder and upload as a .zip file when creating NFTs on platforms like: <br>Objkt.io, Teia.art, Hic.af, Minterverse.io 

### LOW CODE customization

2) Further customization is accessible via code in base.css
3) Create unique names for downloadable content in track.js
